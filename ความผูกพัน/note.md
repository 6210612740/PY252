# Attachment
- Definition => Close emotional bond between two
people (or animals).
- Different theories:
  - Freud: infants become attached to the person who
provides oral satisfaction (e.g. Through feeding) : ผ่านการพัฒนาขั้น แรก oral stage
  - Behaviorism: attachment through reinforcement : ผ่านการเสริมแรว
  - Erikson: trust comes from physical comfort and sensitive
care
  - Harlow: infants prefer contact comfort over food : ผ่านการให้ความอบอุ่นมากกว่าอาหารของทารก
    - Harlow monkey experiment

## Harlow’s Study
- Time spent with “mother”

## Bowlby’s Theory

- Infants + parents biologically
predisposed to **form attachments : มักจะผ่านร่างกายในทารกับพ่อแม่**
  - E.G. Lorenz (1935) study on
imprinting (Critical period for
imprinting is shortly after birth)
  - E.G. Crying, cooing, **clinging to
mother**, smiling, following the
mother
- **Critical period: 6 months – 2-3
years**
- During this time, infant should
receive continuous care : ช่วงนี้ต้องได้รับการดูแลอย่างสม่ำเสมอ
- Develops in 4 phases
  - Phase 1: birth – 2 months
    - Attachment directed to other humans (eg. Parents, strangers)
  - Phase 2: 2-7 months
    - Attachment focused on one person (usually primary caregiver)
    - Learns to distinguish between familiar and unfamiliar people : หัดแยกแยะว่าใครคุ้นเคย
  - Phase 3: 7-24 months
    - Specific attachments develop (eg. Mother and father)
    - Locomotor skills -> Actively seek contact with regular caregivers
  - Phase 4: 24 months +
    - Become aware of others’ feelings
    - Take these into account in forming own actions
- Consequences of maternal deprivation : ผลเสียจากการกีดกันจากแม่
  - Delinquency : การกระทำผิด
  - Reduced IQ
  - Increased aggression : ความก้าวร้าว
  - Depression
  - Affectionless psychopathy : โรคจิตเภทที่ไร้ความรัก

## Ainsworth
### Ainsworth’s Strange Situation
- Individual differences in attachment
  - Strange situation: observational measure of infant
attachment
  - Requires infant to move through
    - Introductions
    - Separations
    - Reunions and adult stranger in [prescribed order :(ตามลำดับที่กำหนดไว้)] : การกลับมาพบใหม่

### Ainsworth’s Theory of Attachment
- 4 attachment styles
  1. Securely attached babies ส่วนมาก
     - When caregiver is present, infants will explore the room
     - When caregiver leaves infant cries
     - When caregiver retures, infants reestablish positive interaction
(e.g. Climbing onto lap, smiling)
     - Resume playing with toys in room
  1. Avoidant babies
     - Avoid caregiver
     - Not distressed when caregiver leaves room
     - Does not interact when caregiver comes back
     - If contact then infant leans/looks away

  2. Resistant (ambivalent) babies
     - Clings to caregiver in strange situation room
     - Do not explore playroom
     - Cry when caregiver leaves
     - Push caregiver away when he/she returns
  3. Disorganized babies
     - Dazed, confused, fearful
     - Strong avoidance and resistance of caregiver
       - E.g. Extreme fearfulness around caregiver

## Adult Attachment
- Adult Attachment in **romantic relationships** (Hazan &
Shaver, 1987)
  - Secure attachment style: Have a positive view of
relationships and find it easy to get close to other
  - Avoidant attachment style: Are hesitant about getting
involved in romantic relationships
  - Anxious attachment style: Demand closeness, are less
trusting, more emotional, jealous, and possessive

### Research Findings for Adult Attachment
- 60-80% of adults describe themselves as being securely
attached (Zeifman & Hazan, 2008)
- Infants who were securely attached at 1 years old were
securely attached in adult relationship at age 21
(Steele et al., 1998)
- Securely attached infants were in more stable romantic
relationships than insecurely attached infants
(Salvatore et al., 2011)
- Security predicts more positive romantic relationships
(Holland & Roisman, 2010)
- Anxiously attached individuals showed strong
ambivalence toward romantic partner (Mikulincer et
al., 2010) and relationship commitment than securely
attached individuals (Joel, MacDonald & Shimotomai, 2011)
- Avoidant and anxious adults have lower sexual
satisfaction than secure adults (Brassard et al., 2012)
- Insecure attachment linked with chronic disease such
as cardiovascular disease (McWilliams & Bailey, 2010)
- Avoidant and anxious adults linked with depressive
symptoms (Jinyao et al., 2012)

## Benefit of Secire Attachment
- Mikulincer and Shaver (2012)
  - Self-acceptance
  - Self-esteem
  - Self-efficacy
  - Emotional control
  - Optimistic
  - Resilient : ยืดหยุ่น
  - Activate cognitive representations of stability -> effective coping

- Li and Chan (2012)
  - Better relationships with partners

## Conclusion

- Other factors may also play a role in relationship
functioning
